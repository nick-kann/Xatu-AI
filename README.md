## What is Xatu AI?

**Xatu AI** is a project focused on developing a machine learning model to predict the first Pokémon a player is likely to send out in Pokémon Showdown. This gives users a signifcant edge by allowing them to instantly counter their opponent's first move. The name draws inspiration from the Pokémon Xatu, a psychic bird known for its ability to see into the future with its right eye. \
